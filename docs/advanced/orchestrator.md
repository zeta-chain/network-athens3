## Orchestrator / Coordinator Steps

**These should only be run by the ZetaChain coordinator, and only after all PRs
containing the gentx and other information from operators have been submitted.
Operators should ignore this document. **

### Collector - Merge all PRS 

`git pull` the merged branch so that you have all the files in the gentx folder.

`bash ./scripts/genesis_collector.sh `

- This would put a genesis.json into the `genesis_files/config/` folder
  - Commit and push the file to the Repo
